 Gnome Tesserae TODO List
 ------------------------------------------

 As of July 8, 2001, these are some of the things that need doing:

  1. Animated tile movement
  2. Tiles need to be prettier
  3. Internationalization & localization
  4. Support for multiple tile sets
  5. Help files need to be converted to SGML
     (or they need to include an interactive tutorial somehow)
  6. Tarball packaging & RPM .spec needs checking
  7. Debian packaging needs doing
  8. Inclusion in standard Gnome Games package needs to be investigated
