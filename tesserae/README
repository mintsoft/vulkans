=====================

Gnome Tesserae
==============

Gnome Tesserae is a game of tile layering based on Matt Mullen's
PC-Tesserae for DOS (http://www.mattmullen.net/).

Installation
--------------
Please see the file named `INSTALL'.  If you're compiling and
installing by hand, be sure to heed the instructions regarding where
to install the program.

Help Wanted
--------------

If you're interested in helping out with any of the items in the
`TODO' file, please let me know.  I'm particularly anxious to get the
game's strings translated and to have Debian binary packages built.
