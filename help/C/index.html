<a name="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>

<p>
Gnome Tesserae is a simple but addictive puzzle game in which the
player tries to remove all the tiles on a mosaic.
</p>

<hr>

<a name="tutorial"><h2>Step-by-Step Tutorial</h2></a>

<a name="tutorial-new-game"><h3>1. Starting a New Game</h3></a>

<p>
Your goal is to remove all the tiles on a mosaic except the last one.
There are several mosaics to choose from; to pick one, start a new
game by selecting <em>New Game</em> from the <em>Game</em> menu.
Pick the mosaic you'd like from the resulting dialog box.
You can also choose between several difficulty levels in this dialog.
</p>

<a name="tutorial-jumping-tiles"><h3>2. Jumping Tiles</h3></a>

<p>
When you start a new game, the mosaic is filled with tiles of various
colors.  Each tile also has a shape imprinted on it that corresponds
to its color.  You can jump with any of these tiles in the right
situation; see the <a href="tutorial-jumping-rules">Jumping Rules</a>
section for details.
</p>

<p>
To select a tile you want to jump with, click it once.  A silver
border will show up around the selected tile.
</p>

<p>
To jump over another tile, select a tile, then click the place on the
mosaic where you want it to land.
</p>

<p>
To remove a tile, jump over it with another tile.
</p>

<p>
Suppose we have the mosaic shown below and we want to remove the
circled tile:
</p>
<p>
<img src="starting-mosaic.png" alt="[picture of mosaic with circled tile]">
</p>
<p>
To remove a tile, you jump over it with another tile.  We could remove
the circled tile by jumping over it with the red tile to its left:
</p>
<p>
<img src="proposed-first-jump.png" alt="[picture of proposed first jump]">
</p>
<p>
But look!  The tile we wanted to remove is gone, but the tile we
jumped with has combined with the tile it landed on:
</p>
<p>
<img src="first-jump.png" alt="[picture of first jump]">
</p>
<p>
We'll learn how to deal with these combination tiles in the next step.
</p>

<a name="tutorial-combination-tiles"><h3>3. Combination Tiles</h3></a>
<p>
When two tiles are combined, they form a third tile that blends the
colors and is imprinted with all the shapes from its composite tiles.
To get rid of such a combination tile, we need to subtract each
composite tile from it.
</p>
<p>
Suppose, for example, that part of our mosaic looks like this:
</p>
<p>
<img src="composite-problem-1.png" alt="[picture of composite problem]">
</p>
<p>
To get rid of the silver tile (a combination of red, blue, and
yellow tiles), let's first subtract yellow:
</p>
<p>
<img src="composite-problem-2.png" alt="[picture of first part of composite
problem solution]">
</p>
<p>
Once we've done this, we can subtract blue:
</p>
<p>
<img src="composite-problem-3.png" alt="[picture of second part of composite
problem solution]">
</p>
<p>
And finally, we just have a red tile where we used to have a silver tile:
</p>
<p>
<img src="composite-problem-4.png" alt="[picture of end of composite
problem solution]">
</p>

<a name="tutorial-jumping-rules"><h3>4. Jumping Rules</h3></a>
<p>
You can jump a tile in either of the following situations:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The tile you're jumping with and the tile you're jumping over
      are both single-color, single-shape tiles.
  <li>The tile you're jumping over contains all the colors that the
      tile you're jumping with contains.

</ul>

<p>
In either situation, the tile you're landing on must not
already contain any of the colors from the tile you're jumping with.
</p>
 
<a name="tutorial-jump-previews"><h3>5. Jump Previews</h3></a>
<p>
When you select a tile, a silver highlight is placed on the tiles you
can jump to.  
</p>

<a name="tutorial-undo"><h3>6. Undo</h3></a>
<p>
If you don't like a move you've made, you can use the <em>Undo
move</em> command from the <em>Game</em> menu to take it back.
</p>

<a name="tips"><h2>Strategy Tips</h2></a>

<a name="tips-remove-outside-inwards"><h3>Remove Tiles from the Outside Inwards</h3></a>
It's usually easier to remove tiles when you have a single section of
them instead of several seperate sections.  Removing tiles around the
edges of your mosaic first will help your maintain a single cluster of
tiles in the center of the game board instead of many small,
hard-to-remove clusters.
</p>

<a name="tips-remove-plan-ahead"><h3>Recovering from Mistakes</h3></a>
If you find yourself in a tight spot after making a move, use the 
<em>Undo move</em> command from the <em>Game</em> menu.  You can use
it repeatedly if you've made several moves that you want to take back.
</p>

<hr>

<a name="preferences"><h2>Adjusting Preferences</h2></a>

<a name="preferences-sound"><h3>Turning Sound Effects On or Off</h3></a>

<p>
To turn sound effects on or off, select <em>Preferences</em> from the
<em>Settings</em> menu.  Check the <em>Sound Effects</em> box to turn
on sound effects; uncheck it to turn sound effects off.  To make your
changes take effect, use the <em>OK</em> or <em>Apply</em> button.
</p>

<a name="bugs"><h2>Bugs and Limitations</h2></a>

<a name="bugs-known"><h3>Known Issues</h3></a>

<ul>
  <li>Tile jumping isn't animated.
  <li>There should be support for different background images and tile
      sets.
  <li>There should be an interactive tutorial.
  <li>Gnome Tesserae is only available in English.
</ul>
